Fuji EdgeX API Notes RE: conversion to OpenAPI (Geneva)

Responses (General)
* Eliminate "413":
            description: if the number returned exceeds the max limit.
			reason -- Pagination is being included on all GET endpoints that return
					  a list. We should always cap the number of results, never more than
					  50 per page, for example. It should be impossible to return too many results.

All endpoints returning a list support pagination via offset (starting index) and limit (items per page)

Question, should I return a "GetDeviceResponse" rather than just the "Device" model?
