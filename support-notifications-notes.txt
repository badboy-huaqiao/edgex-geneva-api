I eliminated the following two endpoints:
/notifications/start/{start}/{limit}:
/notifications/end/{end}/{limit}:
In my opinion, the user should use the full route and either specify NOW as the end (in the first case) or ZERO as the start (in the second case).

Currently we only support retrieval of notifications in they're in the NEW status:
/notifications/new/{limit}:
I'm going to extend this like so
/notifications/status/{status}:

I am normalizing the "label search" endpoint to only take one label and not a comma-delimited list. If it's a list, it should be
more properly specified as a querystring parameter.
/notifications/labels/{labels}/{limit}:

Something I noticed is that you can have only one subscription per notification. This is because the "slug" property is used to monitor
a given notification. The "slug" acts like a name for the notification and must be unique. But there is also a constraint within 
notifications to have the slug be unique. That would mean in order to add receivers to the subscription, one would need to update
the subscription to contain a new Channel to support the additiona delivery via REST or EMAIL.

I have also eliminated subscription-based routes allowing for comma-delimited lists in the route like the following:
/subscriptions/categories/{categories}/labels/{labels}:
Instead these will be refactored similar to how the above notifications/label route works
/subscriptions/category/{category}
/subscriptions/label/{label}
If it necessary to support searching by multiple values at once, these should then be added as querystring parameters
to the /subscriptions/all route.
I also wonder why it is that we support these endpoints for subscriptions but not for notifications...?

I have eliminated this weird mix of routes for deleting transmissions by status if they're older than a specified age.
/transmissions/sent/age/{age}:
/transmissions/escalated/age/{age}:
/transmissions/acknowledged/age/{age}:
/transmissions/failed/age/{age}:
I consolidated these to one route allowing deletion of all transmissions by age, regardless of status.
